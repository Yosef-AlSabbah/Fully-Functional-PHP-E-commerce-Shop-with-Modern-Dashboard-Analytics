## About This Project
This project was created 2 years ago as part of my learning journey. It was built with PHP, and has since been a foundational project for improving my understanding of full-stack web development. While it showcases the core principles of an e-commerce platform, I continue to enhance my skills and apply new techniques in more recent projects.
